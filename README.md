# Objectives 
      The objective behind this project was to get an online presence for local shopkeepers and retailers. 
      As we are very well aware how much have online marketing giants affected their businesses so badly, 
      there is a high need to   provide them with an online stage to showcase their business and services to a wider audience and thus increase their sales. 
      
      After discussion with the retailer, we found an online presence for every retail offline shop is a necessity in today’s world where the consumer now is more and more updated with tech.  
      
      By building this website, the shop can gain better reach at its location and thus could attract more customers from nearby localities. 
      
      It will be helpful for both increasing sales and marketing of the shop. 
      
      The website will be developed as per the requirements told by the client.
      Its features will help enable consumers to place orders online, get updated to latest offers by the shop, 
      and get a daily tech news from the website’s blog page. 
      
      The scope of the project is very huge and our basic framework and backend development can be used to make 
      websites for different types of retailers across the country by altering the design elements enabling them to gain an online presence in their local markets.    

# MOTIVATION

      The main motivation behind the project was to give an online presence to the local retailer in his market.
      Another big point of motivation was the scope and scalability of project. 
      
      The scope of the project is very huge and our basic framework and backend development can 
      be used to make websites for different types of retailers across the states by altering the design elements enabling 
      them to gain an online presence in their local markets. 
      
      Thus we can even extend our project as a service to local shopkeepers by keeping the basic structure 
      and layout of website and differentiating the services and features as per requirements of our client.
