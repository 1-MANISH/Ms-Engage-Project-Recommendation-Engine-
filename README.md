# Objectives - 
      The objective behind this project was to get an online presence for local shopkeepers and retailers. As we are very well aware how much have online marketing giants affected their businesses so badly, there is a high need to provide them with an online stage to showcase their business and services to a wider audience and thus increase their sales. After discussion with the retailer, we found an online presence for every retail offline shop is a necessity in today’s world where the consumer now is more and more updated with tech.  By building this website, the shop can gain better reach at its location and thus could attract more customers from nearby localities. It will be helpful for both increasing sales and marketing of the shop. The website will be developed as per the requirements told by the client. Its features will help enable consumers to place orders online, get updated to latest offers by the shop, and get a daily tech news from the website’s blog page. The scope of the project is very huge and our basic framework and backend development can be used to make websites for different types of retailers across the country by altering the design elements enabling them to gain an online presence in their local markets.
